# Airline-Operations-and-Passenger-Analysis-Report
**Overview**

This project provides a SQL-driven analysis of airline operations and passenger trends, supporting route optimization, capacity management, and demand analysis to improve profitability and efficiency.

**Objectives**

Identify popular routes by calculating total passengers for origin-destination pairs.

Measure seat utilization to optimize resources.

Highlight top-performing routes and busiest airports.

Analyze seasonal trends in flights and passenger volumes.

Identify underutilized routes for capacity adjustments.

Track year-over-year growth and route performance trends.

**Problem Statements**

Calculate the total number of passengers for each origin-destination airport pair.

Calculate average seat utilization by dividing passengers by available seats, sorted by utilization percentage.

Identify the top 5 origin-destination airport pairs with the highest passenger volume.

Determine the total number of flights and passengers departing from each origin city.

Calculate the total distance flown by flights from each airport.

Group flights by month and year to calculate the number of flights, total passengers, and average distance traveled.

Calculate the passenger-to-seats ratio for each origin-destination route and filter routes with a ratio below 0.5.

Identify the top three origin airports with the highest flight frequency.

Identify the city (excluding Bend, OR) contributing the highest number of flights and passengers arriving in Bend, OR.

Identify the longest flight route by distance, specifying the origin and destination airports.

Identify the busiest and least busy months by flight count over multiple years.

Calculate the year-over-year percentage growth in passenger numbers for each origin-destination airport pair.

Identify origin-destination routes with consistent year-over-year flight growth.

Identify the top three origin airports with the highest passenger-to-seat ratios, weighted by flight volume.

Identify the peak traffic month(s) for each origin city based on passenger count, including any ties.

Identify origin-destination routes with the largest year-over-year decline in passenger numbers.

Identify origin-destination airport pairs with at least 10 flights and average seat utilization below 50%.

Calculate the average flight distance for each city pair, highlighting the longest routes.

Calculate yearly totals and growth rates for flights and passengers.

Identify the top three busiest routes based on total distance and flight frequency.

**Data Analysis Approach**

SQL Concepts: Data aggregation, joins, subqueries, window functions, and filtering.

Analysis Techniques: Passenger counts, seat utilization, flight frequency, route distance, and growth trends.

**Key Insights**

Route Optimization: Realign services on underperforming routes.

Utilization Improvements: Identify routes with less than 50% capacity.

Seasonal Trends: Adjust schedules to meet peak demand.

Long-Haul Efficiency: Optimize long-distance routes for better profitability.

**Technologies Used**

**SQL**: Core tool for data analysis and insights generation.

**Power BI**: Visualization tool to create dashboards and present insights.
